- Use TailwindCSS for all component styling.
- Buttons should be rounded (`rounded-xl`) with clear contrast and padding (`px-4 py-2`).
- Suggestion cards must include: image, title, type label, and an `Add` button.
- Time fields use 24-hour format (e.g., "14:30").
- Itinerary layout uses a 45%/55% split (left: list, right: map).
- On mobile:
  - Left itinerary panel fills the screen.
  - Toggle opens/closes the panel.
  - Map can be viewed in full-screen modal.
