- Pins are color-coded per day and numbered by insertion order.
- Dragging a pin between days automatically updates its color.
- Suggestions appear as gray pins near the first added destination of the day.
- Clicking a map pin:
  - Opens a bottom panel with name, description, image.
  - Scrolls and highlights the corresponding item in the itinerary list.
- Clicking an itinerary item scrolls the map to that pin and highlights it.
